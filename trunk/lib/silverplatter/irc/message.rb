		# == About
		# Represents a message comming from the server. Is created by IRC::Parser.
		#
		# == Synopsis
		# 
		# == Description
		# SilverPlatter::IRC::Message represents messages received by the server.
		# It provides convenience methods that allow to access information about
		# those messages easier, e.g. who (as SilverPlatter::IRC::User object) sent
		# the message in which channel (SilverPlatter::IRC::Channel object) with what
		# text.
		# Raw message and raw parsed data are still available too.
		# Don't create SilverPlatter::IRC::Message manually, leave that up to
		# SilverPlatter::IRC::Connection (which uses SilverPlatter::IRC::Parser to do so)
		#
		# == Notes
		#
		# == Known Bugs
		# Currently none
		# Please inform me about bugs using the bugtracker on
		# http://rubyforge.org/tracker/?atid=17330&group_id=4522&func=browse
