		# == About
		# Channel represents a Channel in the IRC network.
		# 
		# == Synopsis
		# 
		#
		# == Description
		# Channel is enumerable over the users in that channel and
		# comparable against the normalized name.
		#
		# == Notes
		#
		# == Known Bugs
		# Currently none.
		# Please inform me about bugs using the bugtracker on
		# http://rubyforge.org/tracker/?atid=17330&group_id=4522&func=browse
