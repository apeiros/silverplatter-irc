<<<<<<< .mine

* isupport.channelprefixes - check if that's the correct name for the property
* Check whether channel expressions should be adapted to isupports chanlen
* Check whether we should really wait for RPL_WELCOME/ERR_NOMOTD (probably only RPL_WELCOME) in Connection#login
* Check threading validity of Connection#(create/delete)_(user/channel)
* Send events to @usermanager

* Proper IRC lexer
* me vs. myself, me? vs. myself?
* FIXMEs
* Docs
* Specs
