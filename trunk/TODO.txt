  BUGS
================

* User#quit & User#kill unimplemented
* Following seems buggy (no length): add_expression :chanstring, /[^\x00\x07\x10\x0D\x20,:]/
* rfc2812/commands.rb has some parser.expression calls


  TODO
================

* Add mode argument support in USER (can set +w and +i)
* isupport.channelprefixes - check if that's the correct name for the property
* Check whether channel expressions should be adapted to isupports chanlen
* Check whether we should really wait for RPL_WELCOME/ERR_NOMOTD (probably only RPL_WELCOME) in Connection#login
* Check threading validity of Connection#(create/delete)_(user/channel)
* Send events to @usermanager
* Notification system (Channel, ChannelList, User, UserList)
* formatting or formating?
* Improve situation with altering commands (avoid having to copy blocks e.g.)
* Proper IRC lexer (params part)
* Improve the penalty system (rbot, limechat, original ircd)
* me vs. myself, me? vs. myself?
* FIXMEs
* Docs
* Specs
